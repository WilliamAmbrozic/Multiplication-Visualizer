# Multiplication-Visualizer  
This is a visualizer for modular arithmetic. This was inspired by a video by Mathologer about patterns in times tables and cardiods in the Mandelbrot set based on the power of the recursive equation.
## Main.py  
This program lets the user view a times table and tinker with the number of nodes or the colors of its elements.
