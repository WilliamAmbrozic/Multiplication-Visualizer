# Multiplication-Visualizer  
This is a visualizer for modular arithmetic. This was inspired by a video by Mathologer about patterns in times tables and cardiods in the Mandelbrot set based on the power of the recursive equation. Coded in `python` using `Tkinter` for the GUI and `Turtle` for the canvas.
